    %span.label.label-warning CHECK POLICY
    %p Checks returned unpaid by your bank will be returned to you by the program coordinator.  Your check will not be re-deposited.  Within one week of notification, you must make arrangements with the coordinator (or any board member) to pay the registration fee plus $20.00 (bank charges) by either: 1) cash or 2) another check.  Should your second check be returned, all future payments (regardless of activity) must be made in cash.  If you have any questions regarding this policy, please check with the program coordinator.
